class OverlappingMultiDict:
    """A class that holds several PersiDict objects with different fyle_type-s.

    The class is designed to be used as a container for several PersiDict objects
    that have different file_type-s. All inner PersiDict objects
    have the same dir_name attribute. Each inner PersiDict object is accessible
    as an attribute of the OverlappingMultiDict object.
    The attribute name is the same as the file_type
    of the inner PersiDict object.

    OverlappingMultiDict allows to store several PersiDict objects
    in a single object, which can be useful for managing multiple types of data
    in a single file directory or in an s3 bucket.
