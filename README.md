# Pythagoras

Planet-scale distributed computing in Python.

## What is it?

`Pythagoras` is easy to use framework for cost-efficient
massive algorithm parallelization in Python. It accelerates and
simplifies data science, machine learning, and AI workflows.

Pythagoras offers:

* persistent function memoization that tracks data dependencies and 
changes in the functions' code;
* parallel execution of memoized functions on a local machine 
or in a distributed environment of any scale;
* simple and inexpensive storage-based orchestration backend.

## Usage

* `Introduction to Pythagoras` notebook:

## About The Name

Pythagoras of Samos was a famous ancient Greek thinker and scientist 
who was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"). 
He is most recognised for his many mathematical findings, 
including the Pythagorean theorem. 

Not everyone knows that in antiquity, Pythagoras was also credited with 
major astronomical discoveries, such as sphericity of the Earth 
and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus.
